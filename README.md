# flutter_contactlist_demo


Based on alphabet_search_view

I tried to make a global tool so that it can be re-used easily in any Flutter project.

I added both SMS based share and other social shares into a single screen so that it can be ported to any project easily.

Still need to add multiple number and email option to make it perfect.
